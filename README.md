BEER: the Bayesian Speech Recognizer
====================================

Beer is a toolkit that provide Bayesian machine learning tools for
speech technologies.


Installation
-------------

We recommend to use [anaconda](https://anaconda.org) as the python
distribution. Beer is built upon the [pytorch](http://pytorch.org)
library. Note that we needs pytorch to be installed from source as some
features are not yet present in the Anaconda package. Besides, it also
requires [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) and
[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html).  Finally, the
examples notebook use [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) for
visualtization.
