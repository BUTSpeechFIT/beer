# Configuration to get standard MFCC features.


# Raw signal pre-processing.
srate: 16000        # sampling rate of the signal (Hz)
preemph: 0.97       # Pre-emphasis filter coefficient.
window_len: 0.025   # size of the window for the FFT analysis (second)
framerate: 0.01     # Frame rate of the features (second)

# Filterbank.
apply_fbank: yes    # Set to 'no' to keep just the (log) magnitude spectrum.
nfilters: 26        # Number of filters in the filterbank.
cutoff_hfreq: 7500  # high cut-off frequency of the filterbank (Hz)
cutoff_lfreq: 80    # low cut-off frequency of the filterbank (Hz)
                    # center of the filters.

# Deltas
apply_deltas: yes   # Set to 'yes' to stack derivatives to the signal.
delta_order: 2      # Number of deltas added to the features (0 means
                    # no deltas).
delta_winlen: 2     # Window length to compute the delta features.

# MFCC features.
apply_dct: yes      # Set to 'yes' to get the MFCC features.
n_dct_coeff: 12     # Number of DCT coefficent to keep.
lifter_coeff: 22    # Liftering coefficient.

# Energy features.
add_energy: yes     # Per-frame energy inserted as the first dimension
                    # of the features.

# Post-processing.
utt_mnorm: yes      # Per-utterance mean normalization.
